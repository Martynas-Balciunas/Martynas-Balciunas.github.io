My main role was to program all the managers and ensure that the rest of the code is interacting with them as expected. I also worked on other modules but my main role was to look over the project, bugfix, and ensure everyone was saving their work appropriately on GitHub as I was the most aware of the procedures.

Our game was designed by brainstorming together in meetings, and working on documentation that was required as part of our submission. The main idea was "death is needed" as the core puzzle aspect was collecting items that could only be reached in ghost form. The rest was just basic platforming, health, enemies, and hazards.

    The game was built in Unity using C#, Github for version control and collaboration, most assets made by our team, some audio and fonts were imported.

Some of the components that I built as part of the project:
* UI Manager - Responsible for all UI aspects, and ensuring that actions within the game affect the UI. All UI Functionality was implemented by me, includes buttons, heart ui, key ui, core functionality like pause, settings, and exit.
  
* Platforms - Implemented large part of platform functionality, this includes fixed, timed, and moving platforms.
  
* Core Mechanic Ghost Form - Implemented core mechanic of becoming a ghost upon death, for this to work I was required to create a large part of the health system, appearing of hidden platforms and interactability on form change, ensuring health is not lost in ghost form and other small features required for the form.
  
* Bugfixing - Various bugfixes to ensure code is safe and works as expected, includes helping colleagues on difficult parts. 
  
* Level implementation - Basic implementation adjustment of designed levels to fit game functionality.
