Almost the entire website is a template provided with an incredible developer environment using docker all the credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio </a>.

The Website is hosted using GitHub Pages

The only work that I had to do was customize the website and use some HTML to customize the basics like links, alongside following documentation to ensure GitHub and developer environment is correct.

This has however given me some experience with:
* Docker
* HTML
* Understanding of Websites
* Domain Basics
* GitHub Pages
