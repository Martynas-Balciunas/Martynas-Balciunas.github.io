The Brief Simplified:
1. Design a game that would appeal to 10-16 Year Olds.
2. Showcase your ability to develop a portion of your design.
3. Showcase your ability to design levels, story, and game mechanics (Mostly Documents).

<h1> Summary </h1>
1. I Designed a game based on a given brief.
2. I Created core assets like the player, enemies, bosses, and icons. (Environmental assets such as trees, bushes, audio and tilemaps were from a creative commons license)
3. I successfully implemented the assets and mechanics to create a small functional game.

<h1> Mistakes </h1>
As this was my first ever non-tutorial project I had bugs and unoptimized performance.
I now realize that I could have made the following improvements:
1. Optimizing code by ensuring to not use expensive functions like FindAllObjectsWithTag.
2. More extensive testing to avoid bugs like music being played twice.
3. Using version control software to limit risk of lost files.
4. A larger focus on art, camera work and user experience.
