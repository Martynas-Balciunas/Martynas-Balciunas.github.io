I'm a University of Westminster Games Development Student. I have always enjoyed playing games, and now making them is a new passion! So far I have learned core principles such as: Programming, Game Design, Basic Modelling, and Game Enterprise.

The <a href='/projects/'>Projects</a> section highlights most of my experience. While the <a href='/blog/'>Blog</a> showcases smaller more niche aspects like <a href='/blog/2023/Making-A-Donut/'>Making a Donut!</a>

So far I have worked with: 
* Unity3D, Visual Studio 
* Blender
* GitHub, Git, Docker, WSL(UBuntu), Visual Studio Code
* C++, C#, HTML, CSS, GD Script

In academic year 2025 I am expected to learn:
* Unreal Engine 5 (Engine Architecture)
* Mobile Game Development
* Game Programming Patterns (C++)
